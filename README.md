GLOBAL TERRORISM ANALYSIS WITH MACHINE LEARNING AND TIME SERIES PREDICTION

This project utilizes machine learning techniques, particularly Python libraries such as scikit-learn and Prophet, to analyze global terrorism data. The analysis includes data preprocessing, cleansing, weapon classification, and time series prediction.

OVERVIEW

Global terrorism is a significant concern, and understanding its patterns and trends can aid in mitigating its impact. This project leverages machine learning algorithms and time series forecasting to analyze and predict trends in global terrorism incidents.

FEATURES

•	Data Preprocessing: The raw terrorism data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare it for analysis.

•	Data Cleansing: Various data cleansing techniques are applied to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset.

•	Weapon Classification: Machine learning, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, is used to classify different types of weapons used in terrorist incidents.

•	Time Series Prediction: Prophet, a forecasting tool developed by Facebook, is employed to analyze the time series data and predict future trends in terrorism incidents.

USAGE

•	Data Preprocessing and Cleansing: Run the gtdpreprocess.ipynb notebook to preprocess and gtdcleaning.ipynb notebook to cleanse the raw terrorism data.

•	Weapon Classification: Execute the weaponclassification.ipynb notebook to train the KNN classifier and classify weapons used in terrorism incidents.

•	Time Series Prediction: Utilize the TimeSeriesprediction.ipynb notebook to perform time series analysis and predict future trends using Prophet.

REQUIREMENTS

•	Python 3.x

•	Google colab

•	scikit-learn

•	Prophet
